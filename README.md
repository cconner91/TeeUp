## Golf Games

Players can first select the total number of players that are in their group. TeeUp will provide them a list of different games which will work with the total number of players.

Players may also choose a custom game or customize the pre-set game chosen. 


## Scoring Formats
These define how players or teams are scored. There are 3 primary scoring formats however some games can have a combination of these styles within a match:

### Stroke Play: Counta the total number of strokes over 18 holes.
### Match Play:	Holes are won/lost/tied based on individual hole performance.	
### Points-Based: Players earn points based on hole performance.	



## GamePlay Formats
These define how players or teams play their ball:

### Individual Play: Each player plays their own ball throughout.
### Best Ball (Four Ball): Each player plays their own ball, best score counts
### Scramble: All players hit, best shot is selected, all play from there.	Scramble, Shamble (partial)
### Alternate Shot (Foursomes): Teammates alternate shots with a single ball.
### Modified/Hybrid Formats: Combination of multiple play styles.


## Player Matchup Formats
These define the format in which the players or teams are matched up. 

### Solo
### H2H: Head to Head - 1v1, 1v1v1, 1v1v1v1
### H2H Hybrid: Head to Head in which 1 player is competing against a team (1v2)
### Team Play: Any team against another team where the first number indicates the amount of players on your team and the second number represents the number of players on the opposing team - 2v2, 4v4, 4(solo)
### Modified/Hybrid Formats: Combination of multiple match setup formats.

## Databases

TeeUp will need to utilize the following data sets:

1. Database storing each golf game, including the rules, scoring, player criteria.
     -This may be a custom database I create
     -There will need to be flags on each golf game, primarily for number of players allowed. This way when a user indicates the total players, it will only display the appropriate games that meet the criteria
   
2. User Database
     - This will be have components of an interactive social application where users can create profiles and add other users and create groups
       
3. Course Database - Will need to store the following:
     - Course Names and Locations
     - Course Score Card - So users can input scores in the application and have it align with the holes of the course
     - Course Rating - USGA Course Rating is an evaluation of the difficulty of a golf course for scratch golfers. (More specifically, the number is an estimate of the average scores of the best 50-percent of rounds played by scratch golfers at         the course being rated.)
       Course rating is very easy to understand because it is expressed in strokes. A par-72 course that is easy might have a course rating of 68.9; one that is difficult might have a course rating of 74.5. That means that a scratch golfer              should be expected to average 68.9 strokes in his better rounds at the easier              course; and 74.5 at the more difficult one.
     - Course Slope Rating - The slope rating of a golf course is a measurement of it's relative difficulty for a bogey golfer compared to a scratch golfer. This value ranges from 55 (least difficult) to 155 (most difficult)

To put it another way: USGA Course Rating tells the best golfers how hard a golf course actually plays; USGA Slope Rating indicates how much harder the course plays for "regular" (meaning not among the best) golfers.
   
4. Database to store historic data
     - Users will want to store their playing history

## Handicap

A USGA Handicap Index is a numerical value that represents a golfer's demonstrated playing ability, calculated based on their past scores relative to the difficulty of the courses 
and tees played, essentially providing a portable measure of how well a golfer plays across different courses; it is the official term used by the United States Golf Association to describe a golfer's handicap. 

### Player's Handicap Calculation:
It is calculated by averaging the best 8 "Score Differentials" from a golfer's most recent 20 rounds, taking into account the course difficulty and playing conditions. 

### Purpose:
The Handicap Index allows golfers to compete fairly against others, regardless of the course they are playing on
 
Through the USGA handicap system, players can enter their USGA handicap (A further iteration may be able to API that data in from USGA)

The handicap scoring algorithm will then be applied to different games to ensure the proper number of strokes, points and other scoring is fairly integrated. 

The handicap for a player for a given match is not only based on their actual handicap value, but also with the course rating. If a player is a 10 handicap, and they are playing a tougher golf course, their course handicap may actually be 13.

This will be an optional tool for players to apply when they play a game.

### Course Handicap Calculation:
To convert a player's Handicap Index into a Course Handicap for a specific course and set of tees, use this formula:

Course Handicap = (Handicap Index) Ã— (Slope Rating Ã· 113) + (Course Rating - Par)

Explanation of Terms

Handicap Index: A portable number representing your potential scoring ability (e.g., 10.4)

Slope Rating: How difficult the course is for a bogey golfer compared to a scratch golfer (range: 55â€“155; 113 is average)

Course Rating: What a scratch golfer is expected to shoot (e.g., 71.2)

Par: The expected score for the course (e.g., 72)

Say a golfer has a Handicap Index of 12.3, and they're playing from a tee with:

Slope Rating: 130
Course Rating: 70.5
Par: 72

Course Handicap = 12.3 Ã— (130 / 113) + (70.5 - 72)
                = 12.3 Ã— 1.1504 + (-1.5)
                = 14.15 - 1.5
                = 12.65 â†’ Rounded = 13

So this playerâ€™s Course Handicap = 13.



### How Handicaps are Calulated in Scoring Matches:

Once a player(s) handicap for a match is calculated, in stroke play, it is fairly simple to determine the handicap for scoring the match.

Each hole on every golf course is assigned a difficulty value ranging from 1-18, 1 being the "hardest" and 18 being the "easiest" (assuming it's a standard 18 hole course).

If a player has a handicap of 7 for a given match, they will, as a result, receive an additional stroke on the 7 most difficult holes.

There will be 2 scores for any player using a handicap in their match

### GROSS SCORE: This is the score (in stroke play) the player receives without factoring in the handicap.
### NET SCORE: This is the score (in stroke play) the player receives once the handicap is factored into the score.

E.g. Assume a player has a handicap of 7 for a given match. They are playing the 2nd hole which happens to be the #1 handicap hole on the course (meaning it's considered the most difficult hole on the course). This 2nd hole that this player is playing is a Par 5. Now assume this player 
scores a 6 on this hole meaning it took them 6 strokes to get the ball in the hole. Because this is the #1 most difficult hole on the course AND the player has a handicap of 7, then they will receive a Net Par of 5 when the hole is scored.


### Additional Handicap Calculations

In some formats (e.g., Best Ball, Scramble, Match Play), you apply allowances to the Course Handicap to get the Playing Handicap:

### Stroke Play: 100% of the Handicap

### Best-Ball: 85% (for men), 90% (for women)

### Scramble: Team-based formulas (e.g., 35% of A + 15% of B)

### Custom: Users will be able to enter a custom handicap allowance based on a percentage

So: 

Playing Handicap = Course Handicap Ã— Format Allowance %



## Example Formulas

ðŸ“„ Setup

Assume:

A2: Handicap Index (e.g., 12.3)
B2: Slope Rating (e.g., 130)
C2: Course Rating (e.g., 70.5)
D2: Course Par (e.g., 72)
E2: Allowance % (e.g., 0.85 for 85%)

### JS Code

function calculateCourseHandicap(handicapIndex: number, slope: number, courseRating: number, par: number): number {
  const rawHandicap = handicapIndex * (slope / 113) + (courseRating - par);
  return Math.round(rawHandicap);
}

function calculatePlayingHandicap(handicapIndex: number, slope: number, courseRating: number, par: number, allowancePercent: number): number {
  const courseHandicap = calculateCourseHandicap(handicapIndex, slope, courseRating, par);
  return Math.round(courseHandicap * allowancePercent);
}

// Example
const courseHcp = calculateCourseHandicap(12.3, 130, 70.5, 72); // => 13
const playingHcp = calculatePlayingHandicap(12.3, 130, 70.5, 72, 0.85); // => 11


### Python Code

def calculate_course_handicap(handicap_index, slope_rating, course_rating, par):
    raw_handicap = handicap_index * (slope_rating / 113) + (course_rating - par)
    return round(raw_handicap)

def calculate_playing_handicap(handicap_index, slope_rating, course_rating, par, allowance_percent):
    course_handicap = calculate_course_handicap(handicap_index, slope_rating, course_rating, par)
    return round(course_handicap * allowance_percent)


Example:
course_hcp = calculate_course_handicap(12.3, 130, 70.5, 72)  # => 13
playing_hcp = calculate_playing_handicap(12.3, 130, 70.5, 72, 0.85)  # => 11

# TO DO


1. Define the rules for each golf game so we can build the logic for scoring as well as ensuring only games which meet player number criteria populate appropriately.
2. Find a golf course database where we will pull the course information - This will need to contain the following:
       a. Score Card for course
       b. Slope rating and Course rating for each tee as well as course length from each tee
