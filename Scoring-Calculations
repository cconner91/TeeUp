# Core Data Model

## âœ… Entities to Define

### Players: name, handicap index, course handicap (per tee box)
### Courses: hole data (par, yardage, stroke index/handicap rating)
### Rounds: date, course, players, tees
### Scores: player-hole scores, gross & net
### Games: format, rules, scoring logic



## Key Calculations to Support

### ðŸ§® Handicap Adjustments
Course Handicap = Handicap Index Ã— (Slope Rating / 113)

Adjusted per tee box

For net scoring, calculate Net Score = Gross Score â€“ Handicap Strokes

ðŸŽ¯ Stroke Allocation Per Hole
Use the holeâ€™s stroke index (1â€“18):

For an 18 handicap â†’ 1 stroke on every hole

For a 24 handicap â†’ 1 stroke on every hole + 2 strokes on stroke index 1â€“6

For a 9 handicap â†’ 1 stroke on stroke index 1â€“9 only

Use this to create a hole_stroke_allowance map for each player.

____________________________________

Score calculations are based off of 4 primary factors.

1. "scoringFormat" - This is largely the most important value in score calculation. It not only determines the unit of scoring value (stroke, point or boolean)
        StrokePlay= Incrementing values on each hole with simple sum function
        MatchPlay= A terminary value {Win=1, Draw=0.5, Lose=0}
        PointsBased= An integer value which is determined by the game rules.


2. "gameplayFormat" - While not directly impacting overall scoring, the gameplayFormat.[TYPE] impacts the method in which scores are generated on a hole-by-hole basis because
                      each type of gameplayFormat offers different values which are ultimately accepted as the final score being used per hole. 

3. "matchupFormat" - Again, while this doesn't impact the direct scoring, it impacts how the app stores the scores.

4. Handicap - The optional handicap will influence the scoring when enabled.


interface ScoringCalculator {
  calculateScore(gameData: GameData, players: Player[]): ScoreResult;
}

Where:

GameData contains hole scores, handicaps, etc.
Player represents player or team info.
ScoreResult contains the computed total scores or per-hole results.

Scoring Type Calculator Function:




class StrokePlayCalculator implements ScoringCalculator {
  calculateScore(gameData: GameData, players: Player[]): ScoreResult {
    // Sum strokes over all holes for each player/team
    const results = players.map(player => {
      const totalStrokes = gameData.holes.reduce((sum, hole) => sum + (hole.scores[player.id] || 0), 0);
      return { playerId: player.id, score: totalStrokes };
    });
    return { results };
  }
}
class MatchPlayCalculator implements ScoringCalculator {
  calculateScore(gameData: GameData, players: Player[]): ScoreResult {
    // Count holes won/lost/tied based on head-to-head hole performance
    // This is simplified; depends on matchup format etc.
    // ... logic here ...
  }

}
class PointsBasedCalculator implements ScoringCalculator {
  calculateScore(gameData: GameData, players: Player[]): ScoreResult {
    // Sum points over all holes for each player/team
    const results = players.map(player => {
      const totalPoints = gameData.holes.reduce((sum, hole) => sum + (hole.scores[player.id] || 0), 0);
      return { playerId: player.id, score: totalStrokes };
    });
    return { results };
  }


### Design your scoring logic to be modular:

class ScoringEngine {
  calculateGrossScores(scores: ScorecardData): GrossScoreResult;
  calculateNetScores(scores: ScorecardData, handicaps: HandicapMap): NetScoreResult;
  calculateMatchPlayResults(grossOrNetScores, format): MatchPlayResult;
  calculateBestBallResults(teams, holeScores): BestBallResult;
  calculateSkins(holeScores): SkinsResult;
  // Add more formats as needed
}

Each game type should call into the core engine with a specific scoring strategy

This enables plugging in new formats easily


### Example: Stroke Play Scoring (Net):

for each player:
  net_score = 0
  for each hole:
    gross = player_scores[hole]
    strokes = getStrokesForHole(player.handicap, hole.strokeIndex)
    net = gross - strokes
    net_score += net



### Example: Match Play Scoring:

for each hole:
  player1_net = player1_score[hole] - getStrokesForHole(player1_handicap, hole.strokeIndex)
  player2_net = player2_score[hole] - getStrokesForHole(player2_handicap, hole.strokeIndex)

  if player1_net < player2_net:
    player1_holes_won += 1
  else if player2_net < player1_net:
    player2_holes_won += 1


### Example: Best Ball (Net or Gross):

for each team:
  for each hole:
    best_net_score = min(
      team_player_scores.map(p => p.gross - getStrokesForHole(p.handicap, hole.strokeIndex))
    )
    team_scorecard[hole] = best_net_score

________________________________

## Enhancements

Support team handicap adjustments (e.g., 90% of handicap for best ball)

Add dot game logic (birdies, pars, greenies, sandies, etc.)

Real-time leaderboards: aggregate score states as each hole is played

## Data Storage & API Suggestions

Store all raw scores per player per hole

Store computed values like net scores, skins, matches in derived tables or cache

Use a rules engine or service layer (e.g., ScoreService.calculateNetMatchResult())
