## Scoring Formats
These define how players or teams are scored. There are 3 primary scoring formats however some games can have a combination of these styles within a match:

Stroke Play: Counta the total number of strokes over 18 holes.
Match Play:	Holes are won/lost/tied based on individual hole performance.	
Points-Based: Players earn points based on hole performance.	



## GamePlay Formats
These define how players or teams play their ball:

Individual Play: Each player plays their own ball throughout.
Best Ball (Four Ball): 	Each player plays their own ball, best score counts
Scramble: All players hit, best shot is selected, all play from there.	Scramble, Shamble (partial)
Alternate Shot (Foursomes):	Teammates alternate shots with a single ball.	Alternate Shot
Modified/Hybrid Formats:	Combination of multiple play styles.


## Player Matchup Formats
These define the format in which the players or teams are matched up. 

Solo
H2H: Head to Head - 1v1, 1v1v1, 1v1v1v1
H2H Hybrid: Head to Head in which 1 player is competing against a team (1v2)
Team Play: Any team against another team where the first number indicates the amount of players on your team and the second number represents the number of players on the opposing team - 2v2, 4v4, 4(solo)
Modified/Hybrid Formats:	Combination of multiple match setup formats.


## Scoring

Scoring can be straight up OR handicapped. If handicapped, each player that wishes to have their scoring handicapped will need to have their GHIN handicap input, either manually or from their official GHIN. With this, the application will automatically calculate the scoring based off of that. 

## Money Game

Users will be able to input their wagers into their match and the app will then keep track and determine the money owed at the end of the match based on the scoring rules assigned.

## 1. Basic Stroke Play (Medal Play)

### NUMBER OF PLAYERS
(1+)

### DESCRIPTION & SCORING RULES

## 2. Match Play - Singles

### NUMBER OF PLAYERS
2+

### DESCRIPTION & SCORING RULES
In Match Play, players (or teams) compete hole by hole rather than by total strokes. Players (or teams) are considered the "winner" when they are up on their opponent(s) by more holes than there are holes left to play. 

-Each hole will result in a "win" or a "push" by the player (or team).
-If a player (or team) wins the first hole of the match, they will be considered 1 Up (1U) and the player (or team) who loses that hole would be considered 1 Down (1D).
-If both players (or teams) tie a hole, meaning they receive the same total score on that hole, the hole will be considered a "push".
-If a player (or team) is up by more holes than there is left to play in the match, they will be considered the winner. Depending on the hole number in which this occurs, the results will be shown as ("Holes Up & Holes Left to Play"). For example if
  a Player A is 5U on Player B once they've reached the 15th hole, the match would be considered over with Player A having won 5&4. There are up by 5 holes with only 4 holes remaining (assuming this was a standard 18 hole match).
-Handicapped scoring (if enabled) can alter the number of strokes it takes to win a given hole.

## 9. Wolf

### NUMBER OF PLAYERS
3-4

### DESCRIPTION & SCORING RULES
Wolf is a rotating-player format where each player gets a turn as the ‚ÄúWolf‚Äù and has the power to choose partners ‚Äî or go it alone ‚Äî on each hole. The game blends match play, strategy, and alliances, and is great for 4 players.

Players rotate as the ‚ÄúWolf‚Äù each hole. After drives, the Wolf chooses whether to play solo or pick a partner for that hole.

Before teeing off, establish a playing order: Player A, B, C, D

This order rotates each hole, so everyone gets a turn as the Wolf

Example Rotation:

  Hole 1: A is Wolf
  Hole 2: B is Wolf
  Hole 3: C is Wolf
  Hole 4: D is Wolf
  Hole 5: back to A, and so on

All 4 players tee off in order, while The Wolf watches the other players‚Äô tee shots.

After each drive (in traditional rules), the Wolf must immediately decide whether to pick that player as a partner for the hole.

If the Wolf skips a player, they cannot go back and choose them later.

After the final tee shot, if the Wolf hasn‚Äôt chosen a partner, they can:

Choose the final player, or

Go Lone Wolf and play 1 vs 3

###üí∞ Scoring
Scoring can be done in points or for money. A common version is Nassau-style or per-hole betting.

Teams & Points

Wolf + Chosen Partner vs Other 2:
  If the Wolf's team wins the hole: each wins 1 point
  If they lose: the opposing team each gets 1 point
  Tie: No points or everyone gets 0.5

Lone Wolf (1 vs 3):
  If the Wolf wins: gets 3 points
  If the Wolf loses: each of the 3 opponents gets 1 point

## 10. Bingo Bango Bongo

### NUMBER OF PLAYERS

### DESCRIPTION & SCORING RULES
Bingo Bango Bongo is a points-based golf game where players earn points on each hole based on three specific achievements ‚Äî being first, being closest, and finishing first. 
It's a great equalizer for mixed skill levels because it's not just about the lowest score.

Points: 
1 for first on green (‚Äúbingo‚Äù)
1 for closest to pin when all on green (‚Äúbango‚Äù) 
1 for first to hole out (‚Äúbongo‚Äù).

3 points per hole x 18 holes = 54 total points available

## 11. Vegas

### NUMBER OF PLAYERS
4

### DESCRIPTION & SCORING RULES
Vegas is a team golf betting game where two-player teams compete by combining their scores into a two-digit number on each hole. The team with the lower combined number wins the hole. What makes it unique (and sometimes brutal) 
is how the scores are combined ‚Äî not added, but joined side-by-side.

On each hole, each player plays their own ball (stroke play).

After the hole:

Combine each team's two scores into a two-digit number, with the lower score going first.

Example: If Team A scores a 4 and 5, their Vegas score is 45 (not 9). If Team B scores 5 and 6, their score is 56.

The difference between the two scores is the number of points awarded for that hole.

Using the example above: 56 ‚Äì 45 = 11 points awarded to Team A.

üí• The Twist
Since scores are joined, not added, a single bad hole can swing the match:

Example: Team A scores 3 & 7 = 37

Team B scores 4 & 8 = 48

Difference = 11 points

But if one player scores 10, and the teammate 4, it becomes 410 ‚Äî a massive number.

üßÆ Score Calculation Notes
Always put the lower number first when combining a team‚Äôs scores (e.g., 4 & 6 = 46, not 64)

Some versions allow the higher number first to penalize poor play more ‚Äî this should be agreed upon in advance

üí∞ Betting
Points per hole can be worth a dollar, a quarter, or any agreed unit

The swing in points makes this a high-stakes game over 18 holes

Some groups cap the max points per hole (e.g., 10 or 20) to prevent blowouts

## 13. Snake

### NUMBER OF PLAYERS
3

### DESCRIPTION & SCORING RULES
Snake is a putting pressure game focused entirely on 3-putts. The goal is to avoid being the last person to 3-putt, because the ‚ÄúSnake‚Äù pot grows with every 3-putt ‚Äî and whoever has the Snake last at the end of the round pays the pot.

Everyone plays their own ball

The game starts with no one holding the Snake.

If a player 3-putts, they get tagged with the Snake.

If another player 3-putts later, they take over the Snake.

The Snake continues to pass from player to player with each new 3-putt.

Whoever is holding the Snake at the end of the round pays the agreed-upon pot.

üí∞ Betting Options

üíµ Running Pot (Most Common)
Each time someone 3-putts, $1 (or more) is added to the pot.

The person holding the Snake at the end pays the entire pot.

## 14. Hollywood

### NUMBER OF PLAYERS
2 or 4

### DESCRIPTION & SCORING RULES

Hollywood is a team match play format with a unique twist: each match starts as three separate bets (front 9, back 9, and total 18), and players can choose to press (start a new bet) if they‚Äôre behind. Presses are the heart of the drama ‚Äî they allow teams to claw back into a match or escalate the stakes.

Three matches run simultaneously:

Front 9 (holes 1‚Äì9)
Back 9 (holes 10‚Äì18)
Overall 18

Each match is worth a set amount (e.g., $5, $10, or points).

üèåÔ∏è Match Play Format
Each hole is scored match play-style: win, lose, or halve

The team that wins more holes wins the match (e.g., win 5 of 9 holes to take the front 9)

üîÅ The Press (Key Rule)
A press is a new side bet that starts when a team is behind. It lets them ‚Äúdouble down‚Äù and try to recover losses.

üîπ When Can You Press?
A team is 2 or more holes down in a given match (front 9, back 9, or overall)

They can call a press, starting a new bet for the remaining holes in that match

üîπ Example:
On hole 6, Team A is 3 down on the front 9

They press ‚Üí a new match starts from hole 6 through 9

That side bet is scored separately from the original front 9 bet

Multiple presses can happen, and they stack up ‚Äî creating many small side matches across the round.

üí∞ Betting Example
Let‚Äôs say each bet is worth $10:

Team A wins front 9: +$10

Team B wins back 9: +$10

Team A wins overall 18: +$10

But if three presses were made during the round (and Team B won two of them), the final payout might be:

Team A: +$20

Team B: +$20
‚Üí Essentially, you tally each bet separately and settle up at the end.
