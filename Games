Scoring can be straight up OR handicapped. If handicapped, each player that wishes to have their scoring handicapped will need to have their GHIN handicap input, either manually or from their official GHIN. With this, the application will automatically calculate the scoring based off of that. 

## Money Game

Users will be able to input their wagers into their match and the app will then keep track and determine the money owed at the end of the match based on the scoring rules assigned.

## 2. Match Play - Singles

### NUMBER OF PLAYERS
2+

### DESCRIPTION & SCORING RULES
In Match Play, players (or teams) compete hole by hole rather than by total strokes. Players (or teams) are considered the "winner" when they are up on their opponent(s) by more holes than there are holes left to play. 

-Each hole will result in a "win" or a "push" by the player (or team).
-If a player (or team) wins the first hole of the match, they will be considered 1 Up (1U) and the player (or team) who loses that hole would be considered 1 Down (1D).
-If both players (or teams) tie a hole, meaning they receive the same total score on that hole, the hole will be considered a "push".
-If a player (or team) is up by more holes than there is left to play in the match, they will be considered the winner. Depending on the hole number in which this occurs, the results will be shown as ("Holes Up & Holes Left to Play"). For example if
  a Player A is 5U on Player B once they've reached the 15th hole, the match would be considered over with Player A having won 5&4. There are up by 5 holes with only 4 holes remaining (assuming this was a standard 18 hole match).
-Handicapped scoring (if enabled) can alter the number of strokes it takes to win a given hole.

## 9. Wolf

### NUMBER OF PLAYERS
3-4

### DESCRIPTION & SCORING RULES
Wolf is a rotating-player format where each player gets a turn as the ‚ÄúWolf‚Äù and has the power to choose partners ‚Äî or go it alone ‚Äî on each hole. The game blends match play, strategy, and alliances, and is great for 4 players.

Players rotate as the ‚ÄúWolf‚Äù each hole. After drives, the Wolf chooses whether to play solo or pick a partner for that hole.

Before teeing off, establish a playing order: Player A, B, C, D

This order rotates each hole, so everyone gets a turn as the Wolf

Example Rotation:

  Hole 1: A is Wolf
  Hole 2: B is Wolf
  Hole 3: C is Wolf
  Hole 4: D is Wolf
  Hole 5: back to A, and so on

All 4 players tee off in order, while The Wolf watches the other players‚Äô tee shots.

After each drive (in traditional rules), the Wolf must immediately decide whether to pick that player as a partner for the hole.

If the Wolf skips a player, they cannot go back and choose them later.

After the final tee shot, if the Wolf hasn‚Äôt chosen a partner, they can:

Choose the final player, or

Go Lone Wolf and play 1 vs 3

###üí∞ Scoring
Scoring can be done in points or for money. A common version is Nassau-style or per-hole betting.

Teams & Points

Wolf + Chosen Partner vs Other 2:
  If the Wolf's team wins the hole: each wins 1 point
  If they lose: the opposing team each gets 1 point
  Tie: No points or everyone gets 0.5

Lone Wolf (1 vs 3):
  If the Wolf wins: gets 3 points
  If the Wolf loses: each of the 3 opponents gets 1 point

## 10. Bingo Bango Bongo

### NUMBER OF PLAYERS
3-4

### DESCRIPTION & SCORING RULES
Bingo Bango Bongo is a points-based golf game where players earn points on each hole based on three specific achievements ‚Äî being first, being closest, and finishing first. 
It's a great equalizer for mixed skill levels because it's not just about the lowest score.

Points: 
1 for first on green (‚Äúbingo‚Äù)
1 for closest to pin when all on green (‚Äúbango‚Äù) 
1 for first to hole out (‚Äúbongo‚Äù).

3 points per hole x 18 holes = 54 total points available

## 11. Vegas

### NUMBER OF PLAYERS
4

### DESCRIPTION & SCORING RULES
Vegas is a team golf betting game where two-player teams compete by combining their scores into a two-digit number on each hole. The team with the lower combined number wins the hole. What makes it unique (and sometimes brutal) 
is how the scores are combined ‚Äî not added, but joined side-by-side.

On each hole, each player plays their own ball (stroke play).

After the hole:

Combine each team's two scores into a two-digit number, with the lower score going first.

Example: If Team A scores a 4 and 5, their Vegas score is 45 (not 9). If Team B scores 5 and 6, their score is 56.

The difference between the two scores is the number of points awarded for that hole.

Using the example above: 56 ‚Äì 45 = 11 points awarded to Team A.

üí• The Twist
Since scores are joined, not added, a single bad hole can swing the match:

Example: Team A scores 3 & 7 = 37

Team B scores 4 & 8 = 48

Difference = 11 points

But if one player scores 10, and the teammate 4, it becomes 410 ‚Äî a massive number.

üßÆ Score Calculation Notes
Always put the lower number first when combining a team‚Äôs scores (e.g., 4 & 6 = 46, not 64)

Some versions allow the higher number first to penalize poor play more ‚Äî this should be agreed upon in advance

üí∞ Betting
Points per hole can be worth a dollar, a quarter, or any agreed unit

The swing in points makes this a high-stakes game over 18 holes

Some groups cap the max points per hole (e.g., 10 or 20) to prevent blowouts
